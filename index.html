              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Introduction</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">My name is Jacob Vink, I am 20 years old and am currently in my second/third year of Software Engineering with a minor in Marketing at the University of Guelph. This page contains information on my 8-month co-op term at TD Bank where I was working as a developer Co-op on an Anti Money Laundering team. This page will also talk about my job experiences and how I feel the co-op program has allowed me to grow and is preparing me for life outside of school.  </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Employer info</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">TD Bank is a Canadian multinational banking and financial services that has its headquarters in downtown Toronto. The bank has been operating under the name Toronto-Dominion Bank since 1955 after a merger of the Bank of Toronto and The Dominion bank. TD bank has many software components and teams that are involved with tasks ranging from front-end app development of apps such as TD MySpend to back end teams working on ETLâ€™s, data migrations and the development/integration of large software packages.</p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Job description</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5"> At TD Bank I was working on an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) development team I had a very wide range of tasks that spanned across multiple projects. My main tasks were assisting with a large-scale Canadian upgrade project of our money laundering software, and initiating dev-ops initiatives within my team. On the Upgrade project I was frequently tasked with the analysis and solutions of defects once they were raised by the testing/QA team. I was also tasked with performing some data migrations/modifications and running/debugging full job streams.
              <br>
              The technologies I used at TD bank include:
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Oracle and DB2 databases/queries to perform data migrations and comparisons
              <br>
              <br>
              -	SAS Programming language and other SAS tools such as SAS EG, to run and update jobs
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Unix scripts for wrapping certain jobs and running lists of queries
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Using Jira to submit tickets related to defects
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Using confluence to communicate tasks and progress with other team members
              <br>
              <br>
              -	HP ALM tool for seeing what defects need to be resolved and their current status
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Integrating Jenkins, Bitbucket and Nexus to start a dev-ops pipeline within the team
              </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Goals</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">My overall goals while working at TD Bank was to overall increase my technical abilities and communication skills in a professional/corporate environment. Many of my goals relate to gaining confidence in communication as well as decision making skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my work term goals across the 8 months at TD were:
                <br>
                <br>
                1: Improve my written/verbal communication skills
                <br>
                <br>
                2: Increase my technical knowledge
                <br>
                <br>
                3: Increase my confidence in making informed decisions and acting upon them
                <br>
                <br>
                For my first 4 months at TD my goal was more focused on improving my communication skills. I wanted to be able to communicate effectively with my team, past the language and cultural differences and get my points across in a formal manner. I took action to improve these things by going into detail in my analysis reports, providing additional info and speaking up in daily touchpoint calls.
                <br>
                <br>
                When my work started to get more demanding in the second 4 months of my time at TD, I realised I needed to work more on my technical and decision-making skills. I realised that despite developing new goals and actively trying to gain more technical knowledge that my communication skills still needed some work. I was still having a hard time reaching out to others for knowledge and assistance, instead I was too focused on trying to do everything myself. I started to follow the examples of the other members of my team and ask others for knowledge relating to specific tasks. This lead to me gaining more confidence in my communication skills, helped me to become a better team player as well as provided me with a lot of new detailed technical information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I am very proud of the progress I have made while working at TD. I feel that I have achieved my goals of learning how to better communicate in a professional environment and improve my technical skills. I learned a wide variety of technologies such as oracle and db2 databases as well as some knowledge of SAS programming.

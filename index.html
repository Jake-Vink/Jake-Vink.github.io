              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Introduction</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">My name is Jacob Vink, I am 20 years old and am currently in my second/third year of Software Engineering with a minor in Marketing at the University of Guelph. This page contains information on my 8-month co-op term at TD Bank where I was working as a developer Co-op on an Anti Money Laundering team. This page will also talk about my job experiences and how I feel the co-op program has allowed me to grow and is preparing me for life outside of school.  </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Employer info</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">TD Bank is a Canadian multinational banking and financial services that has its headquarters in downtown Toronto. The bank has been operating under the name Toronto-Dominion Bank since 1955 after a merger of the Bank of Toronto and The Dominion bank. TD bank has many software components and teams that are involved with tasks ranging from front-end app development of apps such as TD MySpend to back end teams working on ETL’s, data migrations and the development/integration of large software packages.</p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Job description</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5"> At TD Bank I was working on an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) development team I had a very wide range of tasks that spanned across multiple projects. My main tasks were assisting with a large-scale Canadian upgrade project of our money laundering software, and initiating dev-ops initiatives within my team. On the Upgrade project I was frequently tasked with the analysis and solutions of defects once they were raised by the testing/QA team. I was also tasked with performing some data migrations/modifications and running/debugging full job streams.
              <br>
              The technologies I used at TD bank include:
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Oracle and DB2 databases/queries to perform data migrations and comparisons
              <br>
              <br>
              -	SAS Programming language and other SAS tools such as SAS EG, to run and update jobs
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Unix scripts for wrapping certain jobs and running lists of queries
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Using Jira to submit tickets related to defects
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Using confluence to communicate tasks and progress with other team members
              <br>
              <br>
              -	HP ALM tool for seeing what defects need to be resolved and their current status
              <br>
              <br>
              -	Integrating Jenkins, Bitbucket and Nexus to start a dev-ops pipeline within the team
              </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Goals</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">My overall goals while working at TD Bank was to overall increase my technical abilities and communication skills in a professional/corporate environment. Many of my goals relate to gaining confidence in communication as well as decision making skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my work term goals across the 8 months at TD were:
                <br>
                <br>
                1: Improve my written/verbal communication skills
                <br>
                <br>
                2: Increase my technical knowledge
                <br>
                <br>
                3: Increase my confidence in making informed decisions and acting upon them
                <br>
                <br>
                For my first 4 months at TD my goal was more focused on improving my communication skills. I wanted to be able to communicate effectively with my team, past the language and cultural differences and get my points across in a formal manner. I took action to improve these things by going into detail in my analysis reports, providing additional info and speaking up in daily touchpoint calls.
                <br>
                <br>
                When my work started to get more demanding in the second 4 months of my time at TD, I realised I needed to work more on my technical and decision-making skills. I realised that despite developing new goals and actively trying to gain more technical knowledge that my communication skills still needed some work. I was still having a hard time reaching out to others for knowledge and assistance, instead I was too focused on trying to do everything myself. I started to follow the examples of the other members of my team and ask others for knowledge relating to specific tasks. This lead to me gaining more confidence in my communication skills, helped me to become a better team player as well as provided me with a lot of new detailed technical information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I am very proud of the progress I have made while working at TD. I feel that I have achieved my goals of learning how to better communicate in a professional environment and improve my technical skills. I learned a wide variety of technologies such as oracle and db2 databases as well as some knowledge of SAS programming.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-5"> I want to thank everyone I had the pleasure of working with at TD for making my first co-op experience absolutely amazing.   </p>

              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Introduction</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">Hello and welcome to my work term report about my time at the Digital Kitchener Innovation lab. My goal for this work term report is to provide an overview of my Four months at the Innovation lab as well as highlight my tasks, experiences and how I have expanded my skillset along the way.</p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Employer info</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">This summer I had the pleasure of working for the city of Kitchener in their digital innovation lab. When you think of a city you wouldn’t think of cutting-edge technology and that’s what made my experience working at digital Kitchener so unique. At the digital Kitchener lab, we were working on many projects that encompass a wide range of technologies from managing large data sets to building, testing and deploying IOT devices.  An interesting fact about the Digital Kitchener lab is that it was funded from the money saved by switching their street light’s over to LED and implementing their streetlight network. The streetlight network includes a node on each of Kitchener’s 15,000+ streetlights with each node being able to control when each light is turned on, how bright the light is etc. Through the efficiencies provided though the combination of LED’s and the new network the city of Kitchener opened up an innovation lab in the Communitech building. The innovation lab’s goal is to come up with more ways to leverage modern technology to make the city more efficient.
              </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Job description</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">I had a very wide range of task while working for the City of Kitchener’s innovation lab. For the first half of the co-op term my main focus was on Clara. Clara is a data visualisation platform that makes use of the public GIS data the city has published. Clara also interfaces IOT sensors developed in the lab and can visualise the sensor data collected around the city. The main purpose of Clara is to provide a home to both the new and old data the city has access to. Later on, in the term my main project became the city of Kitchener’s Alexa skill. The Alexa skill started as supplemental functionality for Clara and was originally intended to provide a voice interface and a way to query Clara’s data from voice. However, as interest built around the Alexa skill it was decided to start a new project for an Alexa skill for the city as a whole. The city of Kitchener Alexa skill uses google analytics to provide answers to the most asked questions by the public. The skill will be able to intelligently provide information such as how to pay parking tickets and when curbside leaf collection occurs by leveraging Alexa services and Kitchener’s open data portal. I was also given the opportunity to use my marketing minor knowledge in community meetings, and through writing public blog posts about the projects in the lab. The skills I needed to complete my tasks were mostly learnt on the job. The general technical and programming knowledge came from school, however the specific knowledge of technologies such of Alexa and Django came from directly working and developing with the technologies. Skills such as teamwork and time management were learned through school classes but strengthened through my time at the Innovation Lab.
              </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Goals</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">
                My goals for this work term were geared towards learning how to develop with an innovative mindset, learn some new technologies and improve my teamwork skills in a start-up environment.  As a smart city developer my goals were directly related to my job tasks, the purpose of the innovation lab is to develop and prototype innovative technical solutions to increase the efficiency of the city. Working well within the small lab team and being able to come up with new tasks were essential skills for working at the Digital Kitchener Innovation lab.
                One skill I wanted to improve and was glad to work on was taking initiative and working independently. Through the work term I was given a lot of freedom in regards to the current project or task I wanted to work on. A very large portion of my work was ‘self made’ and a product of creative freedom, an example of this is our Clara app and the Alexa project. The main focus of the lab was our data visualisation application called Clara, we wanted to learn new technologies such as angular and Django and were allowed to rebuild the app using our preferred tech stack. The Alexa project stemmed from our interest in creating an Alexa skill and integrating it into Clara before it was re-imagined as a stand-alone project for the public.  With the large amounts of freedom that I was given it was important for me to develop my skills in time management and initiative to keep myself busy and productive as well as keep my wide range of tasks moving forwards.
                Looking back on the goals I set for myself this work term, I feel that I accomplished all of my goals. I feel that I have worked effectively both independently and with my lab/city hall colleagues. I have learned to develop and think with an innovative mindset by capitalizing on interests and opportunities to generate potential project ideas. I have also gained experience with many new technologies such as python, Django, AWS and Amazon’s Alexa.

              <p align=left class="mb-5">Hello and welcome to my work term report about my 8-month co-op term at NCR. My goal for this work term report is to provide an overview of my Eight months at NCR and highlight my tasks, experiences and how my time at NCR has helped me grow as a programmer. </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Employer info</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">For the past 8 months I was working at NCR’s Waterloo development office. The headquarters for NCR is located in Georgia in the United states. NCR has over 34,000 employees across 160 different countries. NCR specialises in Enterprise technology and Point of sale systems for restaurants, retailers and banks. NCR is the number 1 global Point of sale software provider for retail, hospitality and is also the number 1 provider of multi-vendor ATM software.  </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Job description</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">At NCR I worked as a software engineer, I was assigned to work on the TXP project on the PI team. The PI team was mainly focusing on providing Support and implementing features to a large bank customer. My team had a wide range of tasks from fixing internal and external bugs, performing upgrades on our other systems, implementing change requests from the bank, and implementing technical debt solutions. For each task I was not only asked to provide the technical implementation but I also had to do the requirements gathering, write the integration tests and provide documentation and demo’s to other team members. Some tasks I worked on included Fixing bugs related to Cheque depositing and dates, Overhauling the Logging system to provide more concise logs to aid debugging, developed linter rules to enforce coding standards and aid in the development of change requests provided by the bank.  </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Goals</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">My goals for this work term were directed at improving my communication skills and teamwork abilities in a fast-paced agile environment. Thought the work term I was also aiming to improve my technical skills wile working with a large software product and improve my skills with new and old development technologies such as Java, cucumber, junit, XML, Jenkins, REST/SOAP and in-house technologies such as “application toolkit”.
                <br> 
                One skill/experience I wanted to achieve at NCR was to become a functioning member of an Agile team. My previous work terms were not situated in agile environments so this was a welcome new experience. I wanted to experience wat it was like to work in a team environment with daily stand-ups and 2-week sprints.  Over the course of my work terms at NCR I feel like I was able to grasp the agile development process and conform to its structure very well. 
                <br>
                Another one of my goals I was able to work on while at NCR was to improve my initiative and my abilities to work independently. When Work from home started due to COVID-19 the ability to work independently was much more important as face to face communication with team members was non-existent. Through the use of picking up tasks un prompted from the backlog and being able to finish these tasks without heavy assistance from my team members I feel like I achieved this goal. I also showed initiative by signing up to join a focus group where I worked with many full-time employees from across different teams and projects to implement coding standards to our software projects.

                Looking back on the goals I set for this work term at NCR I feel like I accomplished what I had set out for. I feel like I became a functional member of an agile development team and I was able to work well both independently and with my team members both in person and online. I have reinforced and gained new skills with software tools such as Java, Cucumber, and junit.

              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Conclusion</h3>
              <p align=left class="mb-5">I was offered an amazing opportunity to work at NCR’s Waterloo development office for the last 8 months. I was fortunate to be able to work in person with my team members before working from home during the lockdown period. I enjoyed learning and working in an agile environment as it offered me real world experience to the theories, I have learned through my school courses. I feel like I am leaving this co-op work term a stronger problem solver and with a much better understanding of the software industry. The skills I learned at NCR will complement the skills I have learned from other co-ops and through my school classes. Theses skills will follow me through the last years of my schooling and will prove invaluable with the continuation of my studies or in the work force past graduation.  </p>
              <h3 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Acknowledgments</h3>
